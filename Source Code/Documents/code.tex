\section{Implementation Results}

\subsection{Environment}

% The hardware and software configuration and the development environment used to implement the software

The implementation was constructed and tested using the following environment on an x86 architecture:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ubuntu Linux (version 10.04.4 LTS)
\item Debian Linux (version Testing/\enquote{Weezy})
\item Python (version 2.6.5)
\item GCC (version 4.4.3)
\item GNU Make (version 3.81)
\end{itemize}

It is expected that the implementation will be compatible with any platform that runs Python and/or C.

% (i.e., names of source code files,
\subsection{Source Files}
\subsubsection{C}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{sbox.h}
\item \texttt{viperBlockTest.c}
\item \texttt{viperCrypt.c}
\item \texttt{viper.c}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Python}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{sbox.py}
\item \texttt{viperBlockTest.py}
\item \texttt{viperCrypt.py}
\item \texttt{viper.py}
\end{itemize}

% dependencies between source code files,
\subsection{Internal Dependencies}
Each version of \texttt{viper} depends on the \texttt{viperCrypt} module with in turn depends on the \texttt{sbox} module.

% names of any software libraries used
\subsection{External Dependencies}
\subsubsection{C}
Only the standard C libraries were used.
\subsubsection{Python}
Each of the following Python modules were imported into one or more source files:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{argparse}
\item \texttt{sys}
\item \texttt{print{\textunderscore}function} \footnote{This function was imported from the \texttt{future} module to provide Python 3.x printing features}
\end{itemize}

% and a description of how the software was build (i.e., how it was compiled and linked)
\subsection{Build Instructions}
\subsubsection{C}
Using the provided \texttt{Makefile} should be sufficient. However the following commands may be used as well:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{gcc -Wall viper.c -o viper.exe}
\item \texttt{gcc -Wall viperBlockTest.c -o viperBlockTest.exe}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Python}
No building is necessary, all required compilation will occur as a result of running \texttt{python viper.py}.
