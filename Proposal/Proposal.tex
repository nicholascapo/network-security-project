\section{Proposal}

To develop an implementation of the Serpent-1 Cipher \cite{wikipedia}\cite{homepage} in \texttt{C} and \texttt{Python}.

Both implementations of the cipher shall be constructed using threads to take advantage of the parallelism of the Serpent Algorithm. The number of threads to be used (up to a limit) shall be specified at runtime.

Each implementation shall be cipher-text compatible with each other and also the reference implementations \cite{referenceImplementation}.
