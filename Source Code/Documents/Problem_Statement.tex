\subsection{Problem Statement}

According to \cite{wikipedia}: \enquote{Serpent was designed so that all operations can be executed in parallel, using 32 1-bit slices. This maximizes [the] parallelism [of the algorithm]}. However, the context of these (and other) statements seem to imply that it would only be efficient to parallelize Serpent in hardware (or very close to hardware, e.g. Assembly). But the efficiency gains of a parallelized implementation in software are not addressed.
