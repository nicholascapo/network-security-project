\subsection{Summary Literature Review}

\blockquote{Serpent is a symmetric key block cipher which was a finalist in the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) contest, where it came second to Rijndael. Serpent was designed by Ross Anderson, Eli Biham, and Lars Knudsen.}\cite{wikipedia}

\subsubsection{Design Methodology}

A significant portion of Serpent was based on the extensive cryptanalysis completed on the Data Encryption Standard (DES). \cite{submission} This allows the authors to design a a stronger cipher while still maintaining the known advantages of DES.

\subsubsection{Parallelism}

From Wikipedia: \blockquote[\cite{wikipedia}]{Serpent was designed so that all operations can be executed in parallel, using 32 1-bit slices. This maximizes [the] parallelism [of the algorithm]}
