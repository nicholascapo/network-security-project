\subsection{Proposed Solution}

Construct a cipher-text compatible implementation of the Serpent Algorithm in both C and Python. Each implementation shall be capable of encryption and decryption using a single thread\footnote{\texttt{pThread} in the case of C, and the \texttt{multiprocessing} module in the case of Python (see the note at \url{http://docs.python.org/library/threading.html} for why \texttt{multiprocessing} was chosen over \texttt{threading})} as well as 32 parallel threads as described in \cite{submission}. These implementations can then be compared for speed and efficiency, in threaded and non-threaded modes, and the results analyzed to determine if there is any advantage to implementing software parallelism in Serpent.
